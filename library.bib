abstract = {This paper presents a semi-empirical model of scroll compressors and proposes a methodology in order to extend this model to vapor-injection scroll compressors. The model takes into account the ideal evolution of the refrigerant throughout the compressor and considers the main sources of losses in the compression process. The model is able to predict the compressor and volumetric efficiencies in terms of ten empirical parameters, which have a direct physical interpretation. For the model validation, a series of four non-injected scroll compressors of different capacities were tested using R-290 and a scroll compressor with vapor-injection (SCVI) was characterized using R-407C. Results show a correct agreement between the experimental and calculated compressor efficiencies, with a maximum deviation of ±5%. Furthermore, the model estimates accurately the discharge temperature of the refrigerant, compres-sor power input, and refrigerant mass flow rate in the suction and injection port. Finally, the SCVI model response was evaluated by varying the intermediate pressure and the injection superheat.

abstract = {A comparison was made between the errors for the simulated and test performance of a scroll compressor based on three generalised modelling approaches. Four types of refrigerants, namely R22, R134a, R407C and R410A, were analysed, each using a number of compressors which cover the low to medium capacity range. It was found that the use of the constant-polytropic-coefficient approach (CPC) yielded much higher errors in the simulated isentropic efficiencies than those based on the constant-polytropic-efficiency approach (CPE) and the Mallen-Saville approach (MS). The CPE was the best among the three approaches considered, although it was computationally the least efficient. The average errors in the simulated isentropic efficiencies ranged from 8.3 to 10.1% for the four types of refrigerants considered while the corresponding errors in the simulated refrigerant mass flow rates and compressor power inputs varied from 1.1 to 1.8% and 7.7 to 10%. Meanwhile, the simplest CPC should be dismissed on account of the large resultant error and the yielding of incorrect trends in the simulated isentropic efficiencies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

abstract = {The current work presents a semi-empirical mathematical model to simulate the unsteady behavior of mass flow rate and power of reciprocating compressors. The model is based on thermodynamic equations fitted to thirteen calorimeter data sets of two compressors with different capacities. The curve fitting suggests linear correlations between the measured values and the thermodynamic equations, indicating that only two calorimeter data sets are necessary for curve fitting. Additionally, the proposed model was also fitted to data sets of 21 other compressors obtained directly from the catalog of two different manufactures. Besides, comparisons of computed and measured values of mass flow rate and power, in transient regime, were conducted for the two fitted compressor curves. A good agreement of results was found for both compressors in either cycling or start-up tests. It was found that the proposed semi-empirical model can be satisfactorily applied to dynamic simulations of the whole refrigeration system. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two-stage rotary compressors are gaining popularity because of their ability to reduce operating and energy costs over the entire compressor life cycle. In this work, a capacity modulation compressor based on a two-stage rotary compressor (CMCTR) is developed to improve the performance of the rotary compressor system. The working principle of the CMCTR is presented and the cycle efficiency of the compressor through two-stage compression is numerically investigated. The CMCTR model considers mass and energy balance for a control volume, the internal leakage condition for all leakage paths, the discharge valve motion, and the force and moment balance. For simulation results, the motor efficiency is estimated with respect to shaft power and the pressure during an entire cycle is obtained with respect to the compression volume for saving mode and power mode. The optimum efficiency of the CMCTR is obtained for the modulation for these modes.},

This geometry model is included in an overall comprehensive compressor model that includes sub-models for friction, leakage, and heat transfer. The results of the comprehensive model were validated using experimental data from a prototype compressor. The prototype compressor has an overall displacement of 23.9 cm 3, and was operated using R410A as the working fluid. The model predicts the volumetric efficiency, discharge temperature, and shaft power of the prototype compressor to within 3.13% MAE, 16.5 K and -13.2 W average deviation, respectively. The trends and spread in the data indicate that additional effort should be focused on the operation of the active sealing elements within the compressor.},

The input variables are: suction pressure, suction temperature, discharge pressure, and compressor rotation speed. The output parameters are: refrigerant mass flow rate, discharge temperature, and energy consumption. Both models are validated with experimental data for the refrigerants R1234yf and R134a; computer simulations show that mean relative errors are below ±10% with the physical model, and below ±1% when artificial neural networks are used. Additionally, the performance of the models is evaluated through the computation of the squared absolute error.

The principal reasons that have determined changes are the substitution of environmentally unfriendly refrigerants and the energy saving necessity. As fundamental component of a vapour compression plant, the compressor is an object of optimizations; the variation of the compressor speed, obtained regulating the supply current frequency of the compressor motor, allows to obtain energy savings. The principal aim of this paper is the determination of an experimental model that represents the variable speed reciprocating compressor working. In particular, equations that allow to get the refrigerant mass flow rate, the compressor input power and the cooling capacity in terms only of the frequency are obtained. The experimental model allows to determine the optimum frequency for each working condition and then the related energy saving.},

This paper studies the effect of the number of empirical coefficients and physical principles on model accuracy and uncertainty by comparing the estimation of five regression models of compressor mass flow rates. The choice of model training data follows the industrial norm, and model accuracy and uncertainty are calculated. The quantitative results show that the use of neither empirical coefficients nor physical principles guarantees good accuracy and reliability.

abstract = {Refrigeration and air-conditioning compressors are designed to work under well-defined conditions. In some applications it is interesting to observe their performances beyond these conditions, for example in the case of a high temperature two-stage heat pump or of a cooling system working at high temperature. In this study a compressor is characterized experimentally with refrigerant R134a and through 118 tests at condensing pressures varying from 8.6 up to 40.4 bar (tsat = 33.9 °C to tsat = 100.8 °C) and evaporating pressures varying from 1.6 up to 17.8 bar (tsat = -15.6 °C to tsat = 62.4 °C). Under these conditions the compressor motor was pushed at its maximal current in several tests. This compressor's performance is mainly characterized by its isentropic and volumetric efficiencies. It presents a maximal isentropic efficiency of 72%, corresponding to a pressure ratio of around 2.5-2.6. The volumetric efficiency decreases linearly from almost 1.0 (for a pressure ratio of 1.3) to 0.83 (for a pressure ratio of 9.7). A slight degradation of the isentropic and volumetric efficiencies is observed when the compressor supply and exhaust pressures are increased for a given pressure ratio; this could be due to an internal leakage. The compressor tests are used to identify the six parameters of a semi-empirical simulation model. After parameter identification, experimental and simulated results are in very good agreement, except for some points at high compressor power where the compressor is pushed at its maximal current. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease, with damage to arteries as a major contributing factor. Arterial stiffness is a factor associated with high systolic and pulse pressure in these patients and is a strong independent factor associated with morbidity and mortality. Arterial stiffness is one of the principal factors opposing left ventricular ejection. The appropriate term to define the arterial factor(s) opposing left ventricular ejection is aortic input impedance. Aortic input impedance depends on TPR, arterial distensibility, and wave reflections. Distensibility defines the capacitive properties of arterial stiffness, whose role it is to dampen pressure and flow oscillations and to transform pulsatile flow and pressure in arteries into a steady flow and pressure in peripheral tissues. Stiffness is the reciprocal value of distensibility. These parameters are blood pressure dependent; arteries become stiffer at high pressure. While distensibility provides information about the elasticity of the artery as a hollow structure, the elastic incremental modulus characterizes the properties of the arterial wall biomaterials independent of vessel geometry. Alternatively, arterial distensibility can be evaluated by measuring pulse wave velocity, which increases with the stiffening of arteries. Arterial stiffening increases left ventricular afterload and alters the coronary perfusion. With increased pulse wave velocity, the wave reflections affects the aorta during systole, which increases systolic pressures and myocardial oxygen consumption and decreases diastolic blood pressure and coronary flow. The arterial stiffness is altered primarily in association with increased collagen content and alterations of extracellular matrix and calcification of the arterial wall. The arterial stiffening estimated by changes in aortic pulse wave velocity and intensity of wave reflections are independent predictors of survival in end-stage renal disease and in the general population. Improvement of arterial stiffening could be obtained by antihypertensive treatments as observed with calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors increase AC and reduce wave reflections. It has been shown that reversibility of aortic stiffening and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors had a favorable independent effect on survival in hypertensive patients with advanced renal disease.},

Several artificial neural networks were used to model three energy parameters of the compressor with high precision. The number of neurons in each ANN was optimized to use the minimum number of neurons without compromising accuracy; very few neurons were used when comparing with other works. Computer simulations show that the ANN model for the mass flow rate has the highest accuracy when compared with the models for the discharge temperature and power consumption. These simulations also illustrate that the ANN model for the discharge temperature presented the lowest accuracy. Using the ANN model, 3D plots were built to analyze the energy behavior of the compressor.},

However, some precautions have to be taken to thwart their flammability. European regulations impose to take stringent measures regarding components and to install heat pumps in unoccupied spaces. Nevertheless manufacturers keep working on components for hydrocarbons. In the frame of a research project on heat pumps for simultaneous heating and cooling, an R407C prototype working with a scroll compressor was built and tested. A near-industrial prototype is today being designed for propane with the help of recent modelling techniques. After having detailed the main issues regarding hydrocarbons as refrigerants, this article reviews scroll compressor modelling studies and presents the development of a thermodynamically realistic scroll compressor model.

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Based on the characterization results, the injection mass flow rate was correlated with the intermediate pressure through a linear expression, and a modified AHRI polynomial was proposed to estimate the compressor power input. The correlations were used in a simple model to predict the intermediate conditions of the SCVI installed in a heat pump prototype with an economizer. The deviations obtained for the evaporator mass flow rate, injection mass flow rate, intermediate pressure, and compressor power input were lower than 5% in all cases. The proposed methodology allows evaluating SCVI in a wide range of operating conditions, being only dependent on compressor characteristics and totally independent of the system in which it is installed.},

To date, proposed models of this kind of compressor are mainly deterministic models, requiring a detailed description of compressor geometry and allowing, in turn, minute calculation of the refrigerant state as function of orbiting angle. Semi-empirical models are largely proposed for standard scroll compressors in order to accurately compute compressor performance without the need of the knowledge of compressor geometrical feature. In this paper, a semi-empirical model of a variable speed scroll compressor with vapour injection is introduced and validated over a set of 63 experimental data finding that 89%-98% of calculated suction and injection refrigerant mass flow rates, compressor electrical power and refrigerant temperature at compressor discharge agree within ±5%, ±10% or ±5 K with respect to the experimental values.},

The experiments conducted with the changing evaporator temperature (Te), different hydrocarbon refrigerant mass (mr), and variation in capillary tube length (Lc). The ANN model working with the feed backward back-propagation and Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm is used to develop the model. This model is used to predict the performance considerations such as power consumption, refrigeration effect and COP.

Finally, the ANN model is an excellent agreement to a multiple regression model with the coefficient of determinations (R2) of 0.989. The minimum correlation coefficient obtained with the ANN method is higher than the maximum correlation coefficient obtained from the MRA. Also, the value of the error of the ANN method is much less than the MRA method indicating the higher confidence coefficient of the ANN. These values indicate that the developed ANN model is more reliable and accurate than the multiple regression analysis. Based on the above study reveals that the ANN approach is a better technique than MRA for performance and prediction of domestic refrigeration system with high accuracy},

abstract = {The first part of this paper presents an experimental analysis of different hermetic scroll compressors using different methods of injection: the first one is without injection, the second one uses vapor injection and the third one liquid injection. The analysis reveals the influence of these methods on the compressor behavior. A simplified model of the scroll compressor is then proposed that takes into account not only the different internal processes but also the refrigerant injection. It assumes that the refrigerant mass flow rate is affected by a heating-up due to a uniform wall temperature. This fictitious wall is supposed to gain heat from the electromechanical losses and from the discharged gas and to loose heat to the suction and to the ambient. The compression step is considered isentropic up to the adapted pressure and then at constant volume until the discharge pressure. The model is able to compute variables of first importance like the mass flow rate, the electric power and the discharge temperature, as well as secondary variables as suction heating-up, discharge cooling-down, and ambient losses. The validation based on 45 experimental results shows excellent results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The main driver for small scale turbomachinery in domestic heat pumps is the potential for reaching higher efficiencies than volumetric compressors currently used and the potential for making the compressor oil-free, bearing a considerable advantage in the design of advanced multi-stage heat pump cycles. An appropriate turbocompressor for driving domestic heat pumps with a high temperature lift requires the ability to operate on a wide range of pressure ratios and mass flows, confronting the designer with the necessity of a compromise between range and efficiency. The present publication shows a possible way to deal with that difficulty, by coupling an appropriate modeling tool to a multi-objective optimizer. The optimizer manages to fit the compressor design into the possible specifications field while keeping the high efficiency on a wide operational range. The 1D-tool used for the compressor stage modeling has been validated by experimentally testing an initial impeller design. The excellent experimental results, the agreement with the model and the linking of the model to a multi-objective optimizer will allow to design radial compressor stages managing to fit the wide operational range of domestic heat pumps while keeping the high efficiency level. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is built at the basic frequency and the map condition as the second-order function of condensation temperature and evaporation temperature. Then it is corrected by the compressor frequency as the second-order function of frequency and by the actual operating condition as the actual specific volume of the suction gas.

The focus of this project is on positive displacement compressors, i.e., reciprocating, rotary, scroll, and screw types, configured as either semi-hermetic or open drive. Compressor performance data for these types of compressors with different sizes were obtained from various manufacturers. One data set consisted of raw experimental data, while the others datasets were based on published catalog data. Mass flow estimates are based on the polytropic compression process with a clearance volume that leads to a volumetric efficiency expression. The overall performance of the model was acceptable with maximum average mean weighted errors of 3.7%, 2.3%, and 0.6% for reciprocating, scroll, and screw compressors, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that the mass flow rate model with parameters estimated using data for one refrigerant accurately predicted data for a different refrigerant. The compressor power requirement is also based on the polytropic model with the introduction of a combined efficiency to account for frictional effects, leakage, and motor performance in hermetic units. Comparisons of the predicted power requirements with data showed that the model fell short of predicting compressor power performance within acceptable accuracy. Average mean weighted errors over a range of operating conditions were 8% for the screw, 7.6% for the scroll, 6.4% for the open-drive reciprocating, and 5% for the semi-hermetic reciprocating compressors. Errors of as much as 40% were observed for some operating conditions.},

abstract = {Domestic heating and cooling will more and more have to rely on heat pumps (HPs) in order to support a more rational use of primary energy consumption. The HP market is mainly dominated by electrically driven vapor compression cycles and by thermally driven sorption processes. The drawback of electrically driven vapor compression cycle is their dependence on an electrical grid and the fact that they increase the winter or summer electricity peak demands. Hence, a thermally driven vapor compression cycle would offer substantial advantages and flexibility to the end user for heating and cooling applications. This paper presents the investigation of an oil-free compressor-turbine unit (CTU) used for a thermally driven HP (TDHP) based on the combination of a HP compression cycle and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The CTU consists of a radial inflow turbine and a centrifugal compressor of the order of 2 kW each, directly coupled through a shaft supported on gas lubricated bearings. The CTU has been tested at rotor speeds in excess of 200 krpm, reaching compressor and turbine pressure ratios up to 2.8 and 4.4, respectively, and isentropic efficiencies around 70%. Comparisons between the experimental data and predictions of models, that are briefly described here, have been carried out. A sensitivity analysis based on the experimentally validated models shows that tip clearance, for both compressor and turbine, and surface roughness of the compressor are key parameters for further improving performance.},

abstract = {Use of small size turbochargers in refrigeration (Joule/Brayton cycles), as those used by utility vehicles, demands real modeling of their behavior. This work uses the axial flow turbine model proposed by document ASHRAE TC 4.7, applying it to a Brazilian turbocharger. The model proposed by ASHRAE requires identification of several parameters as: incidence flow angle, impeller diameter, exit throttle area. The ASHRAE model was tested using real behavior curves, given by Brazilian manufactures. Our work shows that the identified parameters can not be constants when the ASHRAE model is applied to small radial turbines, and also our works show that the throttle area can not be identify using just a shock condition; it needs a mach number correction to represent with veracity the real behavior. We are proposing a new methodology to identify parameters that improves and gives good results for the HVAC component. Results obtained and physical explanations are offered for the new parameter identification methodology presented in this paper.},

The method considers four major components of uncertainties due to various sources such as measurement uncertainties of training data and equation of state. The change of the predicted map uncertainty with the degree of extrapolation and the map accuracy are shown for eight different compressor maps. The results indicate that the uncertainty from model random error increases significantly as the maps extrapolate though extrapolation does not necessarily imply inaccurate compressor map outputs. The results also show that the uncertainty due to training data is the most significant component of uncertainties when the maps are not extrapolated.},

An analysis is conducted for modeling the variable speed compressor for simulation of inverter air conditioner and heat pump. Having scattered the real operation performance of inverter compressor into infinite operation performance of constant speed compressor, the map-based method is utilized to fit the performance curves of inverter compressor. The model is built at the basic frequency and the map condition as the second-order function of condensation temperature and evaporation temperature. Then it is corrected by the compressor frequency as the second-order function of frequency and by the actual operating condition as the actual specific volume of the suction gas. This method is used to set up simulation models of three different compressors. Compared with the data provided by the compressor manufacturers, the average relative errors are less than 2, 3 and 4% for refrigerant mass flow rate, compressor power input and coefficient of performance (COP), respectively. This model of variable speed compressor is suitable for the simulation of inverter air conditioner and heat pump systems. Based on the experimental data and simulation model, the frequency at zero mass flow rate and power input at zero frequency are discussed and the relation between COP and compressor frequency is analyzed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.

For the combined scroll expander-compressor unit, power was recovered from a scroll expander which replaced the expansion valve and transmitted to the first stage auxiliary compressor which was directly coupled to the expander through a common crankshaft. Numerical simulation on its performance showed that for the suction pressure of 3.5 MPa, discharge pressure of 10 MPa with expander inlet temperature of 35 °C, the main compressor input could be reduced by 12.1% by the expander output. Increase in the cooling capacity by the expander was 8.6%. As a consequence, COP improvement of the cycle was estimated to be 23.5% by the application of this expander-compressor unit. COP improvement increased with lowering the expander inlet temperature, but decreased with increasing the suction pressure. Performance of the scroll expander was relatively insensitive to changes of operating pressure ratio, whereas that of the scroll compressor decreased rapidly as the operating pressure ratio became far from the design pressure ratio. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the benefits of liquid flooded compression, an R410A scroll compressor was tested over a wide range of operating conditions while flooding POE oil into the compression chamber using a hot-gas bypass test stand. The experimental results indicate that oil flooded compression leads to an increase in refrigerant mass flow rate and a decrease in compressor discharge temperature. Also, every operating condition has a maximum limit of possible oil injection, which depends on the system pressure ratio and the dimensions of the injection and discharge ports. By fitting the experimental data, a performance map for the compressor with oil flooding is developed using a semi-empirical model. This map can be used to assess the benefits of the oil flooding technology for various conditions employed in other applications.},

Thereafter, power consumption and efficiency of the compressor can be calculated. Tests were used to verify the overall model on a macroscopic basis. Using the simulation program based on the overall compressor model, a parametric study of the scroll compressor was performed, and the effects of internal leakage and heat transfer losses were investigated and some preliminary results were obtained.

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed model for the compression process of a scroll compressor, which is used for investigating a compressor's performance under different operating conditions and subject to design changes. Upon defining the compressor chambers as suction chambers, compression chambers and discharge chambers, a geometry study was conducted and the governing mass and energy conservation equations were developed for each chamber. Models for the refrigerant flow in the suction and discharge processes, radial and flank leakage, and heat transfer between the gas and scroll wraps were combined with the conservation equations. The state of the refrigerant changes with a period of angle 2$\pi$, and thousands of step are used to solve the governing differential equations during each period. It is assumed that in each step the compressor is in steady state. Since the differential equations for the different chambers are coupled, all these equations are solved simultaneously using a nonlinear equation solver.

abstract = {Variable speed compressors offer continuous control, low noise level, reduced vibration, low-start current, rapid temperature control, by operating the compressor at higher speeds initially, and better COPs than the conventional on/off control. However, there exist some drawbacks concerning the inverter efficiency, the effect of the inverter on the induction motor and the effect of variable speed on the compressor isentropic and volumetric efficiencies. This study gives some experimental results as to inverter and compressor performances: it can be observed that the inverter efficiency varies between 95% and 98% for compressor electrical power varying between 1.5 and 6.5 kW ; and that compressor efficiencies are not enormously influenced by compressor supply frequency, but depend mainly on compressor pressure ratio, except the tests developed at 35 Hz and one test at 40 Hz, for which the difference is attributed to the compressor internal leakages due to a lack of lubrication at low speeds. At 75 Hz there was also observed a slight degradation that can be attributed to the electromechanical losses that increase with compressor speed. A maximal isentropic efficiency of 0.65 for a pressure ratio of the order of 2.2 is obtained. The volumetric efficiency decreases linearly from 0.98 for a pressure ratio of 1.5 to 0.83 for a pressure ratio of 5.6. In spite of the test conditions (condensing and evaporating pressures up to 40 and 20 bar, respectively), the compressor performance stays unchanged. The experimental results obtained at 50 Hz are used to identify six parameters of a semi-empirical model which is then used to simulate the different tests developed at different compressor speeds. The simulated results are in very good agreement with those measured with averages errors of -0.5 K; +3 g s-1 and -24 W for the exhaust temperature, the refrigerant flow rate and the compressor electrical power, respectively. The results show that motor losses induced by the inverter are negligible. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In the last decades, several technological improvements to positive displacement compressors have been developed and introduced into market. During the process of implementing new compressor technologies, high-accuracy numerical models are essential to predict the performance at both component and system levels. ANSI/AHRI Standard 540 10-coefficient cubic polynomial model is still the industry-standard compressor mapping approach despite the well documented limitations. In order to generate accurate compressor maps by using the 10-coefficient cubic polynomial models, compressor manufacturers are required to obtain, in some cases, more than 20 compressor-calorimeter data points depending on the compressor type and operating envelope. This paper attempts to address the need for more generalized and versatile compressor mapping methodologies as well as to reduce the time-consuming and expensive compressor calorimeter testing. To this end, an automated compressor performance mapping approach based on artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to identify the compressor operating envelope and map the performance of any positive displacement compressors for HVAC&R applications with minimum number of data points. In addition, the paper also aims at demonstrating the feasibility and reliability of the proposed automated compressor performance mapping approach for training the ANN models in comparison to conventional 10-coefficient cubic polynomial maps. Three different compressor types, i.e. reciprocating, scroll, and rotary rolling piston, have been considered as test cases.},

Some of these parameters may be found in the technical datasheets of compressors whereas others are determined in such a way that the calculated mass flow rate and electrical power match those given in these datasheets. The two models have been tested on five reciprocating compressors and five scroll compressors. This study has been limited to compressors with a maximum electrical power of 10 kW and for the following operating conditions: evaporating temperatures ranging from -20 to 15 °C and condensing temperatures ranging from 15 to 60 °C. The average discrepancies on mass flow rate and power for reciprocating compressors are 1.10 and 1.69% (for different refrigerants: R134a, R404A, R22, R12 and R407C). For scroll compressors, the average discrepancies on mass flow rate and power are 2.42 and 1.04% (for different refrigerants: R134a, R404A, R407C and R22). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.},

The extent to which knowledge, skills, and transfer of learning from one subject to another are affected by music has not been determined. The main purpose of this case study was to analyze the impact that a musical storytime activity would have on emerging reading skills on special education preschool students. The researcher composed music in order to implement the singing of children's books. The findings indicated that music was especially useful in helping preschoolers with a communication impairment develop emerging reading skills.

The model is built on thermodynamic grounds, and its key parameters are calibrated using experimental data. A total of 33 crankshaft compressors were used for validation purposes, being 26 single-speed and 7 variable-speed, with strokes ranging from 2 to 20 cm³. For conventional single-peed compressors, approximately 97% of the mass flow rate and 93% of the power consumption data presented errors within the 10% thresholds. For variable-speed compressors, more than 95% of the datapoints presented absolute errors lower than 10% for both power consumption and mass flow rate. In addition, the proposed approach was employed to predict the performance of a linear oil-free compressor with variable-displacement capacity control, showing errors for performance characteristics within the range of the experimental uncertainties.},

abstract = {Transport is almost entirely powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs) burning petroleum-derived liquid fuels and the global demand for transport energy is large and is increasing. Available battery capacity will have to increase by several hundred fold for even light duty vehicles (LDVs), which account for less than half of the global transport energy demand, to be run on electricity alone. However the greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) would be worse than that of conventional vehicles if electricity generation and the energy used for battery production are not sufficiently decarbonized. If coal continues to be a part of the energy mix, as it will in China and India, and if power generation is near urban centers, even local urban air quality in terms of particulates, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide would get worse. The human toxicity impacts associated with the mining of metals needed for batteries are very serious and will have to be addressed. Large prior investments in charging infrastructure and electricity generation will be needed for widespread forced adoption of BEVs to occur. There will be additional costs in the short term associated with various subsidies required to promote such a change and in the longer term, the loss of revenue from fuel taxes which contribute significantly to public finances in most countries. ICEs will continue to power transport, particularly commercial transport, to a large extent for decades to come and will continue to improve. There will also be a role for low-carbon and other alternative fuels where they make sense. However such alternatives also start from a low base and face constraints on rapid and unlimited growth so that they are unlikely to make up much more than 10% of the total transport energy demand by 2040. As the energy system is decarbonized and battery technology improves there will be an increasing role for BEVs and hydrogen which could replace liquid hydrocarbons in transport and the required infrastructure will evolve. Meanwhile, there will certainly be increasing electrification, particularly of LDVs in the form of hybridization to improve ICEs.},

abstract = {This work presents an analysis to predict the energy performance of a reciprocating compressor working with refrigerant R134a using artificial intelligence. The compressor is located in a vapor compression system; tests were experimentally obtained and were used to develop two models: one using an artificial neural network and another one using a probabilistic neural network. Because the relationship between the compressor input variables and the respective output variables is complex, these techniques of the area of artificial intelligence are excellent methods to model this type of compressor. The compressor input variables were: compressor rotation speed, suction pressure, suction temperature and discharge pressure. The compressor output variables were: mass flow rate, discharge temperature and energy consumption. Computer simulations were performed to train and validate the proposed methods. In order to measure the performance of these methods, the mean squared error was computed for each experimental test and for each model. The simulations results were used to establish the validity of the models. Finally, the main contribution of this paper is to extend the use of artificial intelligence to predict and simulate the behavior of a reciprocating compressor.},

abstract = {A semi-empirical modeling procedure for twin-screw compressor performance simulation is proposed in this paper. In detail, the compression process is split into a number of stages, taking into account fluid leakages, heat transfers as well as heat and power losses. Compared to the simplified models reported in technical literature for other positive-displacement units, a different formulation for ambient heat loss is proposed, while mechanical power losses are modeled according to torque losses depending on both load and viscous friction effects. The proposed model applies to open-drive compressors, so three specific units for refrigeration applications with medium-high evaporation temperature are selected as the test cases for model tuning and validation, based on manufacturer's catalog data. After the identification of eight parameters, the model is able to compute the mass flow rate, the shaft power and the fluid discharge temperature, as well as volumetric and compressor efficiencies and ambient heat losses. Contrary to geometric models, the semi-empirical procedure proposed in this study does not take the presence of lubricating oil into account, as (i) oil injection with no external cooling results in a thermal neutral process; (ii) the compression work for the oil is negligible in comparison with the one required by the refrigerant fluid; and (iii) even injecting oil at a lower temperature, no considerable saving in refrigerant specific work can be achieved. Actually, this hypothesis does not significantly affect the output of the model. As a matter of fact, referring to the first test case with the larger displacement volume and to the identification of the eight model parameters based on eight convenient data points, the mass flow rate delivered by the compressor is predicted with a maximum error up to 2.44%, and the shaft power is predicted with an even limited error, except for few points with the lowest and highest pressure ratios, where the shaft power is under-estimated by 5%. Moreover, fluid temperature at the compressor exhaust is calculated with an error within ±1 K for pressure ratios up to 7.5. Similarly interesting results are achieved for the other two test case compressors, with absolute values of the errors in mass flow rate and shaft power predictions always less than 3% and 5% respectively. Finally, further considerations on the actual possibility of generalizing the model to semi-hermetic units are suggested.},

The model numerically solves mass and energy balances for each of the compressor's chambers to predict the pressure and temperature variations over a crankshaft revolution. The compressor power input and refrigerant mass flow rate are calculated and used to determine the isentropic and volumetric efficiencies. The model can operate both with and without intercooling between the stages to allow for study of the effects of intercooling on compressor performance.

The analysis reveals the main processes affecting the refrigerant mass flow rate as well as the compressor power and the discharge temperature. Based on these experimental results, a simplified steady-state model of the reciprocating compressor is proposed. The refrigerant mass flow rate is supposed to be affected by the clearance volume re-expansion, by a pressure drop occuring through a supply flow restriction and by a temperature increase due to some heat transfer from a supposed-to-be isothermal wall. The friction power loss is supposed to be transferred to this fictitious wall, which is also exchanging heat with the discharged gas and with the ambient. The model is able to determine the ambient losses and so, the exhaust temperature. The compression itself is considered as adiabatic, reversible and therefore isentropic. The friction power loss is decomposed into a constant contribution and another one proportional to the isentropic power. {\textcopyright} 2002 {\'{E}}ditions scientifiques et m{\'{e}}dicales Elsevier SAS.

In the frame of that study, a hermetic scroll compressor has been equipped with internal sensors by the manufacturer. The analysis reveals the main processes affecting the refrigerant mass flow rate as well as the compressor power and the discharge temperature. Based on these experimental results, a simplified model of the scroll compressor is proposed. It assumes that the refrigerant mass flow rate is affected by a suction temperature increase due to heat gained from a uniform wall temperature. This fictitious wall is supposed to gain heat from the electromechanical losses and from the discharged gas and to loose heat to the suction gas and to the ambient. The compression process is considered to be isentropic up to the "adapted" pressure and then isochoric until the discharge pressure.

abstract = {Mass flow rate and power calorimeter test data for domestic refrigerator/freezer fully hermetic compressors have been collected on compressors from three manufacturers. The calorimeter test data were taken by 10 different organizations. These test data are commonly correlated with 10-coefficient polynomials (using the method presented in ARI Standard 540-91) as a function of the saturated evaporator and condenser temperatures. In general, these polynomial representations accurately represent the experimental data but do not necessarily provide reliable interpolations or extrapolations for conditions not represented in the compressor calorimeter tests. A semi-empirical model to represent compressor performance has been investigated. The model is based on the concept of volumetric efficiency and assumes a polytropic compression process. The model has five parameters that must be determined by fitting experimental data. Four or more measurements of refrigerant flow rate and compressor power were found to be sufficient to determine the model parameters, thereby allowing the generation of accurate compressor maps with the model. The model has been found to extrapolate within 5% error with condensing and evaporating temperatures that extend beyond the measured data by 10°C (18°F). A small set of available data for suction temperatures other than 32.2°C (90°F) were investigated. The results indicate that the model can accurately model the effect of changes in the suction temperature.},
